# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Valentine app UI to use classic (non-cursive) typography and remove the extra prompt line and all meme content from the celebration screen.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove all uses of the `font-cursive` styling so headings and the letter modal title render in a standard non-cursive font.
- Remove the proposal-screen prompt line: "I have something special to ask you... 💕".
- Remove all celebration-screen meme content, including the couple-cats meme image and any visible "MWAAHH" meme text, while keeping the headline and "Open Letter" functionality.

**User-visible outcome:** The app displays all text in a classic non-cursive font; the proposal screen shows only the main question and Yes/No buttons; the celebration screen shows the celebratory headline and an "Open Letter" button without any meme image or "MWAAHH" text.
