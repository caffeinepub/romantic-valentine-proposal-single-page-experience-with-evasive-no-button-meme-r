export const valentineLetter = `I've been trying to find the right words to write this, but honestly, I'm just so obsessed with you. It's only been a few months, but it's crazy because it feels like we've been together for actual years. My love for you just keeps hitting a new level every single day. I still remember our talking stage—I was already so deep in my feelings that I used to think if I didn't get to call you mine, I'd regret it for the rest of my life. That's why I'm such a "despo" sometimes and just blurt out that I love you first, because I literally can't keep it inside.

Everything you do is just so cute to me. I'm obsessed with those silly faces you make, and our calls are hands down the best part of my entire day. Honestly, whenever we hangout, it becomes the absolute best time of my life. You always ask me "why I love you," and I never really have a perfect answer because I don't think words can even explain it. I just know that I love you the most, and I feel so incredibly lucky that you chose me.

I also want you to know that whenever you're feeling heavy or just not okay, please just come to me. I'm always here to listen and understand you. Never, ever think that you're becoming a burden to me—because you could never be a burden in my life. If you need to cry, come cry with me. If you need emotional support, I'm right here. I'll always be your safe place and your biggest support, no matter what.

You honestly have no idea how much I think about you—it's 24/7, all day, every day. I don't think I'll ever be able to fully show you how much I love you, but it's more than you can imagine. I'm honestly so scared of losing you because I've already decided that I want to be with you forever you are all to me baby, fahim.`;
